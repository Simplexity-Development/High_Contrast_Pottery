# Small Tweaks
This is the repo for multiple small tweak resource packs
These resource packs are:

## High Contrast Pottery
Gives decorated pots and sherds a higher contrast so that it's easier to see what the pattern is. Also looks cooler in my opinion

## Accurately Colored Terracotta
Adjusts dyed terracotta to accurately refelct their names
